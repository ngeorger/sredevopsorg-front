# Introduction

One of the **easiest parts** of running a successful digital agency is doing the **actual work**. I mean - who doesn‚Äôt
love to put their head down to collaborate, design, and build amazing stuff for clients?

The **hard bits** are everything else that goes along with that ‚Äì managing large projects with tons of moving pieces,
communicating with clients to properly manage expectations, ensuring you‚Äôre paid on time, and more.

When every billable hour counts, you don‚Äôt have the time to build your own tools from scratch. And you shouldn‚Äôt be
forced to settle for off-the-shelf tech that falls short of your preferred workflow.

**AgencyOS is the open source operating system to help you run (or start) your digital agency.** It‚Äôs built on open
source tools (Nuxt and Directus) and designed to be 100% hackable so you can build YOUR solution, YOUR project
management app, YOUR agency‚Äôs operating system ‚Äì in record time.

**Why?**

Quite a few folks on the [Directus](https://github.com/directus/directus) core team have experience running agencies and
we know it‚Äôs not all rainbows and sunshine. We wanted to build an tool that our
[agency partners](https://directus.io/solutions/agencies) (and any other agency) would get a lot of value from. It was
also created as a complete example to showcase the power and flexibility of Directus as a platform to rapidly build your
own apps and tools.

# **üöß¬†Installation and Development**

There are two main pieces to AgencyOS - the backend and APIs powered by [Directus](https://directus.io) and the frontend
website and application powered by [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com).

## **üê∞ Directus - Backend + Headless CMS**

### 1 - Create a Directus project

There are two ways you can quickly setup a Directus project to use for AgencyOS.

**1a - Register for a Directus Cloud account**

https://directus.cloud/register

This is the easy button. You don‚Äôt have to mess with Docker or working out how to deploy a Directus instance at AWS,
Digital Ocean, or similar hosts. A couple of clicks and in less than 2 minutes you‚Äôll have a ready to go Directus
project.

Directus offers a 14 day free trial for Cloud projects which is plenty of time to give AgencyOS a spin. Note: After the
14 day trial you will need to pay for the service.
[Consult the Directus pricing page](https://directus.io/pricing/cloud) for the latest pricing information.

OR

**1b - Self Host a Directus Instance**

If you're prefer to self-host Directus, we highly recommend you do so with Docker.

**Important Note**: This is a free and open source community release. Therefore, we cannot provide support for
self-hosted instances WITHOUT an Enterprise Self-Hosted license or formal support agreement.
[Learn more and contact our team for details on Enterprise Self-Hosted](https://directus.io/pricing/self-hosted).

You‚Äôll find a `docker-compose.yaml` inside the repo that you can use to quickly spin up a local instance of Directus to
test with. You should have Docker installed and running on your machine first. You
can¬†**[download it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the **tested and preferred** database vendor for this project. The project
has been tested and verified to work against the docker-compose.yaml file included in the repo. Directus does support
many different SQL database vendors, but we ONLY test this project against PostgreSQL.

```bash
# Navigate to the .directus directory
$ cd .directus

# Run docker compose
$ docker compose up

# Docker does it's thing and your Directus project will be available at http://localhost:8055/ or http://0.0.0.0:8055/
```

You can find more¬†[install instructions using Docker here](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/quickstart.html) on the
Directus documentation.

For deploying the project live, please see the [Deployment](#deployment) section.

### 2 **- Generate a static token for the admin user**

You need the static token to seed the project.

1. Go to the User Directory
2. Choose the Administrative User
3. Scroll down to the Token field
4. Generate token and copy it
5. Save the user (do NOT forget to save because you‚Äôll get an error that shows Invalid token!)

### 3 **- Apply the AgencyOS Template**

Open your terminal, run the following command, and simply follow the prompts.

`npx directus-template-cli@latest apply`

Using the @latest tag ensures you download the most up to date version of our templates - in case you've ran the command
previously.

1. Choose the¬†`Agency OS`¬†template.
2. Paste the URL to your Directus instance
3. Paste your Admin user static token
4. Wait for script to finish

You can learn more about the
[Directus Template CLI tool here](https://github.com/directus-community/directus-template-cli). _Note_: It can take a
few minutes for the template script to run if you‚Äôre using a remotely hosted Directus instance.

<br />

## **‚õ∞Ô∏è Nuxt - Frontend**

For your website and client portal, AgencyOS uses Nuxt as the frontend framework of choice.

### **1 - Clone the repo**

[Use This Template](https://github.com/directus-community/agency-os/generate)

_Or from the terminal_

`git clone https://github.com/directus-community/agency-os.git your-project`

Navigate to the project

`cd your-project`

### **2 - Fix your .env file**

- Change the filename¬†`env.example`¬†to¬†`.env`
- Add the url to your Directus instance
- Add the static token for your admin user you generated above

Your `.env` file should look similar to this.

```env
# Directus Setup
DIRECTUS_URL="https://your-instance.directus.app"
DIRECTUS_SERVER_TOKEN="your_directus_server_token_for_server_only_routes"
SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Stripe Setup (If you want to allow payments within the portal)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### **3 - Install your dependencies**

`pnpm i`

### **4 - Start the development server**

`pnpm dev`

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### **5 - Build for production when you're ready**

`pnpm build`

<br />

# üö¢¬†Deployment

## **Deploying Nuxt - Frontend**

Please check the official¬†[Nuxt Deployment Documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for the
supported providers. Here‚Äôs a few of the more popular hosts that work well with Nuxt.

### One Click Options

Note: Vercel is the recommended deployment target for AgencyOS at the moment because of a few memory issues with the
build process on Netlify.

**Vercel**

## **Deploying Directus - Backend**

If you don't want to mess with DevOps or spinning up servers, you
can¬†[spin up a new project on Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud/)¬†in about 90 seconds.

If you prefer self-hosting, Docker is the recommended way to deploy Directus. Please check the
official¬†[Directus Docker Guide](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/docker-guide.html)
